# On-line Order Batching Algorithm
## :blue_book: Introduction

This project is part of the [4D4L project](https://www.ifl.kit.edu/forschungsprojekte_5762.php) at the [Institute of Material Handling and Logistics (IFL)](https://www.ifl.kit.edu/index.php) from the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/).

This algorithm is based on the scientific paper by Sebastian Henn, which you can read [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054812000020/).
It addresses the on-line order batching problem in an order-picking warehouse, where the goal is to minimize the total completion time of all customer orders arriving within a certain time period. The algorithm modifies heuristic approaches used for static order batching to handle dynamic situations.

### :factory: Order Picking in Warehouse

In manual order picking systems, order pickers walk or ride through a distribution warehouse to collect items required by customers. Order batching involves combining indivisible customer orders into picking orders. The choice of an appropriate batching method can significantly reduce the completion time of a set of customer orders.

### :scroll: Project Details

- **Objective**: Minimize the total completion time of customer orders.
- **Methodology**: Modify heuristic approaches for static order batching to suit dynamic situations.
- **Application**: Suitable for manual, single-person order picking systems in warehouses.

### :books: Key Concepts

1. **Order Batching**:
   - Combining individual customer orders into larger picking orders.
   - Reduces the time and effort required for order picking.

2. **Heuristic Approaches**:
   - Use of algorithms to find approximate solutions for complex problems.
   - Modified to handle dynamic, real-time order arrivals.

3. **Dynamic Situations**:
   - Real-time order arrival and processing.
   - Requires adaptable and flexible batching methods.
